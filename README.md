## Notes

The site is accessible at the following locations:
- [Tor support & Help](https://support.torproject.org/)
- (https://4bflp2c4tnynnbes.onion/)

**This is not a direct support helpdesk** and questions should not be submitted through this site. Head over to ```#tor``` on [OFTC IRC](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=tor) instead.

## Reporting Bugs or Feedback

Bugs and feedback issues can be submitted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/web/support/-/issues). To create a new issue, please [request a new account](https://gitlab.onionize.space/) to access Tor Project's GitLab instance. The process for an account creation may require a couple of hours before another human approves it.

## What is Lektor?
Lektor is the static site generator behind this website. Documentation can be found [here.](https://www.getlektor.com/docs/)

### Lektor as **CMS**

Lektor takes from content management systems like WordPress and provides a flexible browser-based admin interface from which you can edit your website's contents. Unlike traditional CMS solutions, however, it runs entirely on your own computer.

## Translations

To translate the Support Portal, please join the Tor Project team in Transifex. Learn how you can [become a Tor translator](https://community.torproject.org/localization/becoming-tor-translator/).

# Tor Project Support
This repository contains the code for the portal dedicated to answering FAQs and providing information necessary for safe and optimal usage of Tor.

The site is accessible at the following locations:
- https://support.torproject.org/
- http://rzuwtpc4wb3xdzrj3yeajsvm3fkq4vbeubm2tdxaqruzzzgs5dwemlad.onion/

**This is not a direct support helpdesk** and questions should not be submitted through this site. Head over to ```#tor``` on [OFTC IRC](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=tor) instead.

## Reporting Bugs or Feedback

Bugs and feedback issues can be submitted on [GitLab](http://eweiibe6tdjsdprb4px6rqrzzcsi22m4koia44kc5pcjr7nec2rlxyad.onion/tpo/web/support/-/issues). To create a new issue, please [request a new account](https://gitlab.onionize.space/) to access Tor Project's GitLab instance. The process for an account creation may require a couple of hours before another human approves it.

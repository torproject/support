description:
You should use Mullvad Browser if you are looking for a privacy enhanced browser solution to connect with your trusted VPN.
Its default settings and features are intended to combat mass surveillance, data mining and tracking, or other privacy violations that are commonly employed by big tech companies.

While the Mullvad Browser offers similar privacy protections to Tor Browser, it is best suited for the threat model of corporate mass-surveillance by big tech companies.

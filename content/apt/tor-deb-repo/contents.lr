description:

The Tor Project maintains its own [Debian package repository](https://deb.torproject.org). Since Debian provides the LTS version of Tor, this might not always give you the latest stable Tor version. Therefore, it's recommended to install `tor` from our repository.

Here's how you can enable Tor Package Repository in Debian based distributions:

> **Note:** The symbol # refers to running the code as root. This means you should have access to a user account with system administration privileges, i.e. your user should be in the sudo group.

#### Prerequisite: Verify the CPU architecture

The package repository offers `amd64`, `arm64`, and `i386` binaries. Verify your operating system is capable of running the binary by inspecting the output of the following command:

  ```
  # dpkg --print-architecture
  ```

It should output either `amd64`, `arm64`, or `i386`. The repository does not support other CPU architectures.

**Note:** The package repository does not offer 32-bit ARM architecture (`armhf`) images (yet). You should either install the version Debian offers (make sure to check out Debian backports, too, as that one has often a more up-to-date Tor package), or [build Tor from source](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/install/#installing-tor-from-source).

#### 1. Install `apt-transport-https`

To enable all package managers using the libapt-pkg library to access metadata and packages available in sources accessible over https (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure).

   ```
   # apt install apt-transport-https
   ```

#### 2. Create a new file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` named `tor.list`. Add the following entries:

   ```
   deb     [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

If you want to try experimental packages, add these **in addition** to the lines from above:

   ```
   deb     [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

Or nightly builds:

   ```
   deb     [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-main-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-main-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

Replace `<DISTRIBUTION>` with your Operating System codename. Run `lsb_release -c` or `cat /etc/debian_version` to check the Operating System version.

**Note:** Ubuntu Focal dropped support for 32-bit, so instead use:

   ```
   deb     [arch=<ARCHITECTURE> signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main
   deb-src [arch=<ARCHITECTURE> signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main
   ```

Replace `<ARCHITECTURE>` with your system architecture (you found it earlier by writing `dpkg --print-architecture`).

Warning symptom, when running sudo apt update:

   ```
   Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'
   ```

#### 3. Then add the gpg key used to sign the packages by running the following command at your command prompt:

   ```
   # wget -qO- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
   ```

#### 4. Install tor and tor debian keyring

We provide a Debian package to help you keep our signing key current. It is recommended you use it. Install it with the following commands:

   ```
   # apt update
   # apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
   ```

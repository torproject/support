description:

The Tor Project maintains its own [Debian package repository](https://deb.torproject.org). Since Debian provides the LTS version of Tor, this might not always give you the latest stable Tor version. Therefore, it's recommended to install `tor` from our repository.

Here's how you can enable Tor Package Repository in Debian based distributions:

> **Note:** The symbol # refers to running the code as root. This means you should have access to a user account with system administration privileges, e.g your user should be in the sudo group.

#### 1. Install `apt-transport-https`

To enable all package managers using the libapt-pkg library to access metadata and packages available in sources accessible over https (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). 

   ```
   # apt install apt-transport-https
   ```

#### 2. Add the following entries to `/etc/apt/sources.list` or a new file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` 

   ```
   deb     https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

If you want to try experimental packages, add these **in addition** to the lines from above (Note, use whatever is the current experimental version instead of 0.4.5.x from the example below):

   ```
   deb     https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-0.4.5.x-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-0.4.5.x-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

Or nightly builds:

   ```
   deb     https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-master-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-master-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

Replace `<DISTRIBUTION>` with your Operating System codename. Run `lsb_release -c` or `cat /etc/debian_version` to check the Operating System version.

**Note:** Ubuntu Focal dropped support for 32-bit, so instead use:

   ```
   deb     [arch=amd64] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main
   deb-src [arch=amd64] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main
   ```
   
Warning symptom, when running sudo apt update:

   ```
   Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'
   ```
 
#### 3. Then import the gpg key used to sign the packages

   You can download the key directly into `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d` either 
   
   using **cURL**
   ```
   sudo curl https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/torproject.asc
   ``` 
   OR using **Wget**
   
   ```
   sudo wget https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/torproject.asc

   ```
   You can also receive the key from a keyserver using gpg, then export the key into `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d` directory:
   ```
   gpg --keyserver=hkp://keys.gnupg.net --receive-keys 74A941BA219EC810
   gpg --export 74A941BA219EC810 | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/torproject.gpg > /dev/null

   ```
   If you want to avoid ASCII-armored files, go ahead and dearmor it using:
   ```
   curl https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor > /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d
   ```

   
   
#### 4. Install tor and tor debian keyring

We provide a Debian package to help you keep our signing key current. It is recommended you use it. Install it with the following commands:

   ```
   # apt update
   # apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
   ```

description: 

Generally speaking, we don't recommend using a VPN with Tor unless you're an advanced user who knows how to configure both in a way that doesn't compromise your privacy.

You can find more detailed information about Tor + VPN at [our wiki](https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorPlusVPN).

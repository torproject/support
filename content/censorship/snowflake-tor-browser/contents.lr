description:
Snowflake is included in [â€‹alpha releases of Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/alpha/) for GNU/Linux and macOS. Not yet in Windows.
The user flow is the same as selecting another type of [pluggable transport](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention) on Tor Browser. For now, how it works is you select Snowflake from a list of pluggable transport options on Tor Browser and it will automatically connect through a Snowflake for you.

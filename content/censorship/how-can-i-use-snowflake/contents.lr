description:
Snowflake is available in [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) stable for all platforms: Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, and Android.
You can also use Snowflake with [Onion Browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448) on iOS.

If you're running Tor Browser for desktop for the first time, you can click on 'Configure Connection' on the start-up screen.
Under the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from Tor Browser's one of built-in bridges" and click on "Select a Built-In Bridge" option.
From the menu, select 'Snowflake'.
Once you've selected Snowflake, scroll up and click 'Connect' to save your settings.

From within the browser, you can click on the [hamburger menu ("â‰¡")](../../glossary/hamburger-menu/), then go to 'Settings' and go to 'Connection'.
Alternatively, you can also type `about:preferences#connection` in the URL bar. In the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from Tor Browser's one of built-in bridges" and click on "Select a Built-In Bridge" option.
From the menu, select 'Snowflake'.

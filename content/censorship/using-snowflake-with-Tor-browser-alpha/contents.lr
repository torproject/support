description:
Snowflake is included in [â€‹alpha releases of Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/alpha/) for GNU/Linux and macOS. Not yet in Windows.
The user flow is the same as [Meek](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek). For now, how it works is you select Snowflake from a list of pluggable transport options on Tor browser and it will automatically connect through a Snowflake for you.

For more information on integration with Tor bowser see the [documentation wiki](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Snowflake#IntegrationwithTorBrowser).

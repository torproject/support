description: 
If you can't download Tor Browser through our [website](https://www.torproject.org), you can get a copy of Tor Browser delivered to you via [GetTor](https://gettor.torproject.org/).
GetTor is a service that automatically responds to messages with links to the latest version of Tor Browser, hosted at a variety of locations that are less likely to be censored, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and GitHub.

Or if that doesn't work, you can also manually select one of mirrors such as those from [the EFF](https://tor.eff.org), [the Chaos Computer Club](https://tor.ccc.de), or one of many more which you can find in our list [here.](https://2019.www.torproject.org/getinvolved/mirrors.html.en)

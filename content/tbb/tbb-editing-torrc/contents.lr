WARNING: Do NOT follow random advice instructing you to edit your `torrc`!
Doing so can allow an attacker to compromise your security and anonymity through malicious configuration of your `torrc`.

Tor uses a text file called `torrc` that contains configuration instructions for how Tor should behave.
The default configuration should work fine for most Tor users (hence the warning above.)

To find your Tor Browser `torrc`, follow the instructions for your operating system below.

On Windows or Linux:
* The `torrc` is in the Tor Browser Data directory at `Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor` inside your Tor Browser directory.

On macOS:
* The `torrc` is in the Tor Browser Data directory at `~/Library/Application Support/TorBrowser-Data/Tor`.
* Note the Library folder is hidden on newer versions of macOS. To navigate to this folder in Finder, select "Go to Folder..." in the "Go" menu.
* Then type `~/Library/Application Support/` in the window and click Go.

Close Tor Browser before you edit your `torrc`, otherwise Tor Browser may erase your modifications.
Some options will have no effect as Tor Browser overrides them with command line options when it starts Tor.

Have a look at the [sample `torrc`](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/blob/HEAD/src/config/torrc.sample.in) file for hints on common configurations.
For other configuration options you can use, see the [Tor manual page](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en).
Remember, all lines beginning with `#` in torrc are treated as comments and have no effect on Tor's configuration.

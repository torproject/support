Bookmarks in the Tor Browser can be exported, imported, backed up, restored as well as imported from another browser.
In order to manage your bookmarks in Tor Browser, go to:

- Hamburger menu >> Library >> Bookmarks >> Show All Bookmarks (below the menu)
- From the toolbar on the Library window, click Import and Backup

**If you wish to export bookmarks**
- Choose Export Bookmarks to HTML
- In the Export Bookmarks File window that opens, choose a location to save the file, which is named bookmarks.html by default. The desktop is usually a good spot, but any place that is easy to remember will work.
- Click the Save button. The Export Bookmarks File window will close.
- Close the Library window.

> Your bookmarks are now successfully exported from Tor Browser. 
The bookmarks HTML file you saved is now ready to be imported into another web browser.

**If you wish to import bookmarks**
- Choose Import Bookmarks from HTML
- Within the Import Bookmarks File window that opens, navigate to the bookmarks HTML file you are importing and select the file.
- Click the Open button. The Import Bookmarks File window will close.
- Close the Library window.

> The bookmarks in the selected HTML file will be added to your Tor Browser within the Bookmarks Menu directory.

**If you wish to backup**
- Choose Backup
- A new window opens and you have to choose the location to save the file. The file has a .json extension.

**If you wish to restore**
- Choose Restore and then select the bookmark file you wish to restore. 
- Click okay to the pop up box that appears and hurray, you just restored your backup bookmark.

**Import data from another browser**
> Bookmarks can be transferred from Firefox to Tor Browser. There are two ways to export and import bookmarks in Firefox: [HTML file](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer) or JSON file.
After exporting the data from the browser, follow the above step to import the bookmark file into your Tor Browser.

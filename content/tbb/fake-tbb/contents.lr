description:
No, Tor Browser is an open source software and it is free.
Any browser forcing you to pay and is claiming to be Tor Browser is fake.
To make sure you are downloading the right Tor Browser visit our [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download/).
After downloading, you can make sure that you have the official version of Tor Browser by [verifying the signature](../how-to-verify-signature/).
If you are not able to access our website, then visit [censorship section](../../censorship/gettor-1/) to get information about alternate way of downloading Tor Browser.

If you have paid for a fake app claiming to be Tor Browser, you can try to request a refund from the Apple or Play Store, or you can contact your bank to report a fraudulent transaction.
We cannot refund you for a purchase made to another company.

You can report fake Tor Browsers on frontdesk@torproject.org

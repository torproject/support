description:

Digital signature is a process ensuring that a certain package was generated by its developers and has not been tampered with.
Below we explain why it is important and how to verify that the Tor program you download is the one we have created and has not been modified by some attacker.

Each file on our [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download/) is accompanied by a file with the same name as the package and the extension ".asc". These .asc files are OpenPGP signatures.
They allow you to verify the file you've downloaded is exactly the one that we intended you to get.

For example, `torbrowser-install-win64-9.0_en-US.exe` is accompanied by `torbrowser-install-win64-9.0_en-US.exe.asc`.

We now show how you can verify the downloaded file's digital signature on different operating systems.
Please notice that a signature is dated the moment the package has been signed.
Therefore every time a new file is uploaded a new signature is generated with a different date.
As long as you have verified the signature you should not worry that the reported date may vary.

###For Windows users:

[Download](https://www.torproject.org/download/) the .exe installer and its corresponding .asc file. For example, `torbrowser-install-win64-9.0.6_en-US.exe` is accompanied by `torbrowser-install-win64-9.0.6_en-US.exe.asc`. (you may have to right click on the .asc link and select "save as" in order to download it)

[Download](https://gpg4win.org/download.html/) Gpg4win and run its installer.

Next, Proceed to fetch the Tor Developers key. (The Tor Browser team signs Tor Browser releases. Import the Tor Browser Developers signing key (0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290)). To do this, open command prompt by pressing the windows button, type cmd and hit enter. Input the following command: 

  gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys torbrowser@torproject.org

 This should show you something like:

    gpg: key 4E2C6E8793298290: public key "Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:               imported: 1
    pub   rsa4096 2014-12-15 [C] [expires: 2020-08-24]
          EF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290
    uid           [ unknown] Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>
    sub   rsa4096 2018-05-26 [S] [expires: 2020-09-12]

If you encounter errors you cannot fix, feel free to [download (save as) and use this public key](https://openpgpkey.torproject.org/.well-known/openpgpkey/torproject.org/hu/kounek7zrdx745qydx6p59t9mqjpuhdf) instead. Take note of the file name you downloaded and import it with the following commandS (we assume that the file's name is **filename.txt** and that it is downloaded in your "Downloads" folder)

In Command Prompt input:

	cd Downloads
	gpg --import filename.txt

This should show you something like:

    gpg: key 4E2C6E8793298290: public key "Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:               imported: 1

Next, proceed to save it to a file from the command prompt (identifying it by fingerprint here):

gpg --output ./tor.keyring --export 0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290

Verifying the signature. To verify the signature of the package you downloaded, you will need to download the corresponding ".asc" signature file as well as the installer file itself, and verify it with a command that asks GnuPG to verify the file that you downloaded.

The examples below assume that you downloaded these two files to your "Downloads" folder.

In Command Prompt input:
gpgv --keyring .\tor.keyring Downloads\torbrowser-install-win64-9.0.6_en-US.exe.asc Downloads\torbrowser-install-win64-9.0.6_en-US.exe

The result of the command should produce something like this:

gpgv: Signature made 07/08/19 04:03:49 Pacific Daylight Time
gpgv:                using RSA key EB774491D9FF06E2
gpgv: Good signature from "Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>"

###For MacOS users:

[Download](https://www.torproject.org/download/) the installer and its corresponding .asc file. For example, `https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/9.0.6/TorBrowser-9.0.6-osx64_en-US.dmg` is accompanied by `https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/9.0.6/TorBrowser-9.0.6-osx64_en-US.dmg.asc`.

If you are using macOS, you can install GPGTools.

In order to verify the signature you will need to type a few commands in the Terminal (under "Applications").


Next, Proceed to fetch the Tor Developers key. (The Tor Browser team signs Tor Browser releases. Import the Tor Browser Developers signing key (0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290)).

 gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys torbrowser@torproject.org

 This should show you something like:

    gpg: key 4E2C6E8793298290: public key "Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:               imported: 1
    pub   rsa4096 2014-12-15 [C] [expires: 2020-08-24]
          EF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290
    uid           [ unknown] Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>
    sub   rsa4096 2018-05-26 [S] [expires: 2020-09-12]

After importing the key, you can save it to a file (identifying it by fingerprint here) from the terminal:

gpg --output ./tor.keyring --export 0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290

Verifying the signature. To verify the signature of the package you downloaded, you will need to download the corresponding ".asc" signature file as well as the installer file itself, and verify it with a command that asks GnuPG to verify the file that you downloaded.

The examples below assume that you downloaded these two files to your "Downloads" folder.

In the terminal, type:
gpgv --keyring ./tor.keyring ~/Downloads/TorBrowser-9.0-osx64_en-US.dmg{.asc,}

The result of the command should produce something like this:

gpgv: Signature made 07/08/19 04:03:49 Pacific Daylight Time
gpgv:                using RSA key EB774491D9FF06E2
gpgv: Good signature from "Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>"

Workaround (using a public key)
If you encounter errors you cannot fix, feel free to download and use this public key instead. Alternatively, you may use the following command:

curl -s https://openpgpkey.torproject.org/.well-known/openpgpkey/torproject.org/hu/kounek7zrdx745qydx6p59t9mqjpuhdf |gpg --import -

###For GNU/Linux users:

[Download](https://www.torproject.org/download/) the linux installer and its corresponding .asc file. For example, `https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/9.0.6/tor-browser-linux64-9.0.6_en-US.tar.xz` is accompanied by `https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/9.0.6/tor-browser-linux64-9.0.6_en-US.tar.xz.asc`.

If you are using GNU/Linux, then you probably already have GnuPG in your system, as most GNU/Linux distributions come with it preinstalled.

In order to verify the signature you will need to type a few commands in a terminal window. How to do this will vary depending on your distribution.

Next, Proceed to fetch the Tor Developers key. (The Tor Browser team signs Tor Browser releases. Import the Tor Browser Developers signing key (0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290)).

 gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys torbrowser@torproject.org

 This should show you something like:

    gpg: key 4E2C6E8793298290: public key "Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:               imported: 1
    pub   rsa4096 2014-12-15 [C] [expires: 2020-08-24]
          EF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290
    uid           [ unknown] Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>
    sub   rsa4096 2018-05-26 [S] [expires: 2020-09-12]

After importing the key, you can save it to a file (identifying it by fingerprint here) from the terminal:

gpg --output ./tor.keyring --export 0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290

Verifying the signature. To verify the signature of the package you downloaded, you will need to download the corresponding ".asc" signature file as well as the installer file itself, and verify it with a command that asks GnuPG to verify the file that you downloaded.

The examples below assume that you downloaded these two files to your "Downloads" folder.

In the terminal, type:
gpgv --keyring ./tor.keyring ~/Downloads/tor-browser-linux64-9.0_en-US.tar.xz{.asc,}

(change 64 to 32 if you have the 32-bit package)

The result of the command should produce something like this:

gpgv: Signature made 07/08/19 04:03:49 Pacific Daylight Time
gpgv:                using RSA key EB774491D9FF06E2
gpgv: Good signature from "Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>"

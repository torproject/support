term: Tor Launcher
---
definition:

When you run [Tor Browser](../tor-browser) for the first time, you see the Tor Launcher window.
It offers you the option to connect directly to the [Tor network](../tor-tor-network-core-tor), or to configure Tor Browser for your connection.
In the second case, Tor Launcher will take you through a series of configuration options.

Tor launcher is no longer used in Tor Browser since the [10.5 release](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-105).

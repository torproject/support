definition:

Dangerzone is used to convert any document (even pdf) to pdf, when the document is potentially dangerous or from an untrustworthy source. 
This is done by converting the pdf to raw pixel data and then back to pdf.
Dangerzone should be used if you want to convert documents downloaded through Tor, to pdf.

term: domain fronting
---
definition:

Domain fronting is a censorship circumvention technique which masks the site you are connecting to.
From the perspective of a censor, it appears like you are connecting to a major service which would be costly for a censor to block, like Microsoft or Google.
However, it does not make you anonymous, or completely hide your destination like [Tor Browser](../tor-browser) does.

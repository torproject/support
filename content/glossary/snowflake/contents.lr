term: Snowflake
---
definition:

It is a puggable transport, which provides censorship circumvention and access to a free and open internet.
It has three components; the Snowflake client, the Snowflake proxy (the two together known as the Snowflake peers) and the broker.
Snowflake can allow an open browser tab to act as an ephemeral Tor bridge.
In order to beat the blocking of proxy IP addresses, Snowflake involves a large number of volunteer proxies, which also make it hard for the censor to pin down.
